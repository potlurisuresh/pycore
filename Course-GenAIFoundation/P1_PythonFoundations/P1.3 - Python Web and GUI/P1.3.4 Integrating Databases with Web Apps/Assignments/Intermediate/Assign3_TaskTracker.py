Assignment 3: Task Tracker - Add, List, Due Date, Completion (Intermediate)

Scenario:
You are improving your task tracker. In addition to adding and listing tasks, users can now add a due date, mark tasks as completed, and filter tasks by completion status.

Objective:
- Add, list, and update tasks with due date and completion status
- Filter tasks by completion status (all, completed, incomplete)
- Use templates for all HTML rendering

Tasks:
1. Add a due_date (YYYY-MM-DD) and completed (0 or 1) column to the tasks table.
2. Update the add task form to include a due date.
3. Add a button or link to mark a task as completed.
4. Add a filter to view all, completed, or incomplete tasks.
5. Display all tasks on a web page using a template.

Hints:
- Use SQL WHERE for filtering by completion
- Use Jinja2 templating to display tasks and filter options

Rubric:
- Due date/completion logic: 40%
- Add/list logic: 40%
- Code clarity and comments: 20%
