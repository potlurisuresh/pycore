Intermediate Assignment 5: Book Catalog with Add Book Form

Scenario:
Allow users to add new books to the catalog using a form. Display the updated book list using a Jinja template. Store books in a Python list (in memory).

Objective:
- Show a list of books at `/books`
- Provide a form to add a new book (title and author)
- Update the list and display all books

Tasks:
1. Use a `books.html` template for the list and form
2. Implement GET (show list and form) and POST (add book)
3. Store books in a Python list (do not use a database)

Hints:
- Use request.form to get new book data
- Use Jinja to loop over books

Rubric:
- Add book and list update work: 40%
- Uses templates and variables: 40%
- Code clarity and comments: 20%
