Assignment 3: Library Book Tracker (Beginner)

Scenario:
You are building a library book tracker using SQLite and Python.

Objective:
- Create a database and table for books
- Insert multiple book records
- Select books by a specific author
- Use Python to print all book titles in uppercase

Tasks:
1. Create a SQLite database called 'library.db'.
2. Create a table 'books' with columns: id (INTEGER), title (TEXT), author (TEXT).
3. Insert at least 3 books with different authors.
4. Select and print all books by a specific author (e.g., 'George Orwell').
5. Use Python to print all book titles (from the table) in uppercase letters.

Hints:
- Use the sqlite3 module in Python
- Use SQL's WHERE clause for author filtering
- Use Python's str.upper() or a loop to print titles in uppercase

Rubric:
- Database and table created: 25%
- Records inserted: 25%
- Select by author: 25%
- Python uppercase print: 25%
