Assignment 1: Student Database Manager (Beginner)

Scenario:
You are managing a student database using SQLite and Python.

Objective:
- Create a database and table for students
- Insert multiple student records
- Select students with a specific condition
- Use Python to count and print results

Tasks:
1. Create a SQLite database called 'students.db'.
2. Create a table 'students' with columns: id (INTEGER), name (TEXT).
3. Insert at least 3 student records with different names (e.g., 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Anil').
4. Select and print all students whose names start with 'A'.
5. Use Python to count and print the number of students whose names start with 'A'.

Hints:

- Database and table created: 25%
- Records inserted: 25%
