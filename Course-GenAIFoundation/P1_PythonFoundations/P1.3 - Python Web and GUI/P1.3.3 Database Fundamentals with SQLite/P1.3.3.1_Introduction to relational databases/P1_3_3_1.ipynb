    "# 📘 P1.3.4.1 – Database Fundamentals\n",
    "## Topic: Introduction to Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what a database is\n",
    "- Understand why we use databases instead of filesystem\n",
    "- Recognize common types of databases\n",
    "- Understand relational databases at a high level\n",
    "- Explain tables, rows, columns, and data types\n",
    "- Know that SQL is used to manage relational data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 What is a Database?\n",
    "A **database** is an organized place to store data so it can be **saved, searched, updated, and shared** easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **smart storage system** for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ Why Do We Need a Database (If We Already Have Files)?\n",
    "Files can store data, but databases make data **easy to manage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Databases help when you need:**\n",
    "- **Fast search** (find data quickly)\n",
    "- **Reliable updates** (no broken or duplicated data)\n",
    "- **Multiple users** (many people using data at the same time)\n",
    "- **Security & access control**\n",
    "- **Backups & recovery**\n",
    "- **Structured relationships** between data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Types of Databases \n",
    "| Type | Simple Meaning | Example Use |\n",
    "|------|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Relational** | Data in tables with rows and columns | Banking, e-commerce |\n",
    "| **Document** | Data stored as JSON-like documents | Content apps |\n",
    "| **Key–Value** | Data stored as key + value pairs | Caching, sessions |\n",
    "| **Graph** | Data stored as nodes and connections | Social networks |\n",
    "| **Vector** | Data stored as embeddings for similarity search | AI search, recommendations |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Relational Databases \n",
    "A **relational database** stores data in **tables** and connects tables using relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Tables, Rows, and Columns\n",
    "- **Table**: A collection of data organized into rows and columns.\n",
    "- **Row**: store individual records (one person per row)\n",
    "- **Column**: define the type of data (like name, age, email)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tiny example:**\n",
    "| id | name  | email            |\n",
    "|----|-------|------------------|\n",
    "| 1  | Alice | alice@mail.com   |\n",
    "| 2  | Bob   | bob@mail.com     |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Data Types (Simple View)\n",
    "Each column has a **data type** that defines what it can store:\n",
    "- **INTEGER** – whole numbers (e.g., 42)\n",
    "- **TEXT** – words or sentences\n",
    "- **REAL** – decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)\n",
    "- **BOOLEAN** – true/false\n",
    "- **DATE/TIME** – dates and times\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 Managing Relational Databases\n",
    "We use **SQL commands** to create, read, update, and delete data in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn SQL CRUD commands in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Key Takeaways\n",
    "- A **database** is organized storage for data\n",
    "- Databases make data **searchable, reliable, and shareable**\n",
    "- There are multiple database types for different needs\n",
    "- **Relational databases** store data in tables\n",
    "- Tables have **rows**, **columns**, and **data types**\n",
    "- **SQL** is used to manage relational data\n"
