Mini Project 1: Task Manager Web API (Extended)
Level: Intermediate

Concepts Used:
- Flask basics (routes, request handling)
- JSON response
- Web communication fundamentals
- Filtering and status management

Description:
Build a Flask web API for a Task Manager. The API should allow users to:
1. Add a new task (with title, description, due date, and status [pending/completed])
2. View all tasks
3. Update a task (title, description, due date, status)
4. Delete a task
5. Filter tasks by status (pending/completed)

All data should be stored in memory (dictionary/list). Responses must be in JSON format. No authentication required.

Expected Output:
- API endpoints working for CRUD on tasks
- Filtering by status (e.g., /tasks?status=pending)
- JSON responses for each operation
- Example: {"id": 1, "title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk, Bread, Eggs", "due_date": "2026-02-20", "status": "pending"}
