Mini Project 2: Expense Tracker with SQLite
Level: Intermediate

Concepts Used:
- SQLite database basics
- Flask integration with databases
- CRUD operations

Description:
Create a Flask app that lets users track their expenses. The app should:
1. Add a new expense (amount, category, description)
2. View all expenses
3. Update an expense
4. Delete an expense

All data should be stored in an SQLite database. Endpoints must return JSON. No authentication required.

Expected Output:
- Database file created
- API endpoints working for CRUD on expenses
- Example: {"id": 1, "amount": 50, "category": "Food", "description": "Lunch"}
