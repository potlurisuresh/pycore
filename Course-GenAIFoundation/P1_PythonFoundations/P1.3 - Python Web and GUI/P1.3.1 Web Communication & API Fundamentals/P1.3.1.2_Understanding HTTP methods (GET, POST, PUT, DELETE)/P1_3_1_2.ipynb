    "## 🧩 Before We Start: What is HTTP?\n",
    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the **communication protocol** between a client and a server.\n",
    "The web follows a **request → response** model:\n",
    "- A client (browser/app) sends a request\n",
    "- The server returns a response\n",
    "- Every action on the web is an HTTP request\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ Why Do HTTP Methods Exist?\n",
    "When a client talks to a server, it must clearly state **what action** it wants on a server.\n",
    "HTTP methods are that action signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of intent:\n",
    "- “Get me data”\n",
    "- “Create something new”\n",
    "- “Update existing data”\n",
    "- “Delete a resource”"

    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "- GET /users → safe, idempotent\n",
    "- POST /users → not idempotent (creates new user each time)\n",
    "- PUT /users/5 → idempotent (replaces same resource)\n",
