    "## ❓ What is an API?\n",
    "API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.\n",
    "It defines **how two software systems talk to each other** using requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Why APIs Matter\n",
    "- They let apps share data and functionality\n",
    "- They hide internal complexity behind a clean interface\n",
    "- They enable integration across services\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔎 Common API Types (REST is one of them)\n",
    "There are multiple styles and technologies for APIs:\n",
    "- **REST** (most common on the web)\n",
    "- **SOAP** (older, XML-based, strict standards)\n",
    "- **GraphQL** (client can request exactly what it needs)\n",
    "- **gRPC** (fast, binary, service-to-service APIs)\n",
    "- **WebSockets** (real-time two-way communication)\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is popular because it is simple, readable, and built on standard HTTP."

    "## 🧩 What is REST?\n",
    "**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**.\n",
    "It is a style of designing web APIs so that clients and servers can communicate in a consistent, predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs are **stateless** — each request contains all the information the server needs to process it.\n",
    "The server does not remember previous requests from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "In REST, you interact with **resources** (data objects) using standard HTTP methods."

    "### 1) Resources\n",
    "A resource is a piece of data you can access or modify.\n",
    "Examples: users, products, orders, posts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Endpoints\n",
    "An endpoint is a URL that represents a resource.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- /api/users\n",
    "- /api/products/42\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Representation\n",
    "The resource is represented in a format like JSON or XML.\n",
    "Most modern APIs use JSON."
