    "\n",
    "- Prevents overfitting (model memorizing training data instead of learning patterns).\n",

    "- Gives a realistic estimate of how well the model will perform in the real world.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ML models require numeric data; text must be converted (vectorized).\n",
    "- Always split your data for training and testing to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "- Check your data quality: missing values, outliers, and incorrect labels can mislead the model.\n",
    "- Use factual, real-world examples and avoid blindly following steps—understand why each step is needed.\n",
    "- If you skip vectorization or train-test split, your model will not work as expected.\n",
