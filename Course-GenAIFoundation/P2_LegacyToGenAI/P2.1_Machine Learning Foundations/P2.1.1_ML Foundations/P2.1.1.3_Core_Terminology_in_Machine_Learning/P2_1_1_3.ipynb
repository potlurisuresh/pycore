    "- Data is the collection of facts, examples, or measurements that we use to teach a machine learning system.\n",

    "- Data provides the foundation for learning. It contains the patterns and relationships that the model will try to discover.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is an algorithm?**\n",
    "- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules that tells the computer how to learn from data. In machine learning, it is the method used to find patterns and build models from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔎 Purpose:**\n",
    "- The algorithm is the underlying method that processes data and produces a model. For example, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) algorithm is used to train a Linear Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🛠️ Where is it used?**\n",
    "- Algorithms are used during the training phase to process data and create models. The same algorithm can be used to build different models for different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**❓ Do we need to write an algorithm for each problem?**\n",
    "- No, most machine learning libraries provide standard algorithms (like OLS for Linear Regression, CART for Decision Trees, etc.) that can be reused for many problems. You usually select and configure an existing algorithm rather than write one from scratch."

    "\n",
    "**🛠️ How do we get a model?**\n",
    "- By training: We use an algorithm (like OLS, CART, etc.) to find the best model that fits the data. For example, the LinearRegression class in scikit-learn is a model class that uses the OLS algorithm to learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Purpose:**\n",
    "- The model is used to make predictions or classify new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**❓ Do we need to write a model from scratch?**\n",
    "- No, we usually use pre-built model classes from libraries (like scikit-learn). We just need to create an instance and train it with our data. The model class (like LinearRegression) is a template, and the trained model is the result after fitting it to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏳ Is a model trained immediately after importing?**\n",
    "- No, after importing and creating a model instance, you must train (fit) it on your data before it can make predictions."
