    "An **embedding** is a list of numbers that represents an item (text, image, audio).\n",
    "It is how we **turn meaning into numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple flow:**\n",
    "1. Take a piece of data (e.g., a sentence)\n",
    "2. Convert it into numbers → **embedding**\n",
    "3. Store those numbers in a **vector database**\n",
    "4. Find similar items by comparing these numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example idea:**\n",
    "- \"cat\" and \"kitten\" → embeddings close to each other\n",
    "- \"cat\" and \"car\" → embeddings far apart"
